    <h1>Privacy Policy for CenterGrade</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 30, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>CenterGrade</strong>. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the data you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our centering measurement tool.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Images and Camera Access:</strong> To provide centering measurements, the app requires access to your device’s camera or photo library.</p>
    <p class="note">Note: Images are processed locally on your device. We do not upload, store, or share your card photos on our servers unless explicitly stated for cloud backup features.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous data regarding how the app is used (e.g., number of scans performed, crash logs) to improve performance.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our service or to serve advertisements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AdMob (Google):</strong> Used to display advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers to personalize ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> (e.g., Firebase) to track app stability and user engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect personal identification or upload your images to a central server, we do not "retain" your personal data. Any data stored locally (like a history of your card grades) remains on your device until you delete the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Given that Pokemon collecting is popular among all ages, we ensure our ad settings are configured to be "Family Friendly" where possible.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (such as the EU under GDPR or California under CCPA), you have the right to access, delete, or limit the use of any data collected. Since we do not store personal data on servers, these rights are largely managed by you deleting the app or clearing its cache.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
